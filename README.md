# Conway's game of live in C
**This is a learning journey project, expect a lot of newbie C code!**
A very naive implementation of the Conway's game of live written in C. Made for a college presentation.
To compile and execute, run `make run` in the cloned directory. Modify world state in the `automatas.h` file by adding live cells.
